# -STONE-PAPER-SCISSOR-GAME
#EXPLANATION
 in the program we built the hashtag#intransitive_hand_game
for developing the game we need to require some' if else statements ' & ' switch case ' for controlling flow of conditions. basically in the program compare between two approaches by entered from the user's.
#LOGIC
1) first in the program we just simple print the instruction statement by using ' printf statement '
2) for getting the data we use simple ' scanf statement ' & this statement use 
2 times for getting two input.
3) after scanning inputs we just compare inputs and about the game rule we declare winner.
4) otherwise the condition are not satisfied we ' anounce ' the given condition is ' drawn '
